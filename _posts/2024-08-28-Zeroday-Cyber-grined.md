### [Zero-Day] Cyber grind


[zero-day cyber grind] is the program where I plan to document my journey in the cybersecurity field. The goal of this blog is to share and store all of my experiences, including what I've learned after completing CTFs, reading books, or engaging in other related activities. This blog will be updated every 2-3 weeks, depending on my free time.

Once again, thank you all for visiting my site. I hope I can keep my word and continue to share my journey with you.
